## Ploting Character controls

The us of this app is to easily cycle through the base plotting characters.

There is a slider and 2 numeric controls.

The original goal was to have the points ploted be persistent but time prevented me from learning how to do this properly

a link to the repo is here:
<https://github.com/PGKearnsCoursera/Moving_Points>.




## Slide with app capture
a screen cap of the image can be seen here

```{r pic, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics('./Capture.png')
```
